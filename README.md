This is a project made as apart of the final for a class at Hartwick College. It is an unofficial system made to combat issues with managing volunteer information and their experiences (Certifications, Trainings, etc.)
The system allows for adding, editing, and deleting information about these volunteers through a Python GUI and SQLite3 database. It's also capable of sending emails about concerning expirations or new experience opportunities.
